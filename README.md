## For the completed interactives, download and visit mouse.html. 

## testdis.html is the interactive mimicking users with a motor disability. 

## rainbow.html is the interactive with no rogue interfaces. 

## The data analysis is found in the mouse_data notebook. 

### Leah Findlater, Karyn Moffatt, Jon E. Froehlich, Meethu Malu, Joan Zhang from the University of Maryland researched touchscreen accessibility for users with motor impairments in 2017. The study examined how people with motor disabilities navigate web pages using mouse and touchpad interfaces, asking participants to perform controlled experiments to assess how motor impairments influence usability. The researchers then performed the same experimental tasks on individuals without motor impairments. The raw data can be found here: https://github.com/leahkf/mouseandtouchinput. By uploading the data in Python, and calculating the average start and end times of each demographic, I found it took participants with motor disabilities twice as long to perform dragging movements with a mouse than participants without a motor disability. On average, it took a participant with motor disability about 73 seconds, while it took a person without a motor disability about 41 seconds.
